# GIRLS WHO CODE 

Girls who code is my first website. 
It's a project coded using HTML, CSS, Sass and Bootstrap. 
Ths site's content is not original, it was inspired by two organizations founded by woman who inspired me to get in this industry: Girls Who Code by Reshma Saujani and Kode with Klossy by Karlie Kloss.
